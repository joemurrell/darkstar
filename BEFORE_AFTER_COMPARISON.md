# Quiz Diversity Enhancement - Before/After Comparison

## Problem Statement
The bot was generating repetitive quiz questions with repeated keywords (e.g., "PUSHING", "FUMBLE") across multiple questions, providing poor user experience.

## Solution Overview
Implemented comprehensive diversity enforcement with deduplication, regeneration, and logging.

---

## BEFORE vs AFTER

### 1. Prompt Structure

**BEFORE:**
```
Generate 6 multiple-choice questions based ONLY on the attached PDF.

Requirements:
- Each question must have exactly 4 options
- Include the correct answer (A, B, C, or D)
- Provide a brief explanation with page number citation
- Focus on practical knowledge for DCS pilots

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "q": "Question text here?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explain": "Brief explanation with page reference (p.XX)"
  }
]
```

**AFTER:**
```
Generate 6 multiple-choice questions based ONLY on the attached PDF.

Requirements:
- Each question must have exactly 4 options
- Include the correct answer (A, B, C, or D)
- Provide a brief explanation with page number citation
- Focus on practical knowledge for DCS pilots
- Ensure every question covers a different topic or concept from the PDF 
  and avoid repeating the same keywords across multiple questions 
  (for example, do NOT repeat 'PUSHING' or 'FUMBLE')

Return ONLY a valid JSON array with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "q": "Question text here?",
    "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "answer": "A",
    "explain": "Brief explanation with page reference (p.XX)",
    "page": 12,
    "topic": "engine-trim"
  }
]

Each question MUST include:
- "topic": A short hyphenated tag or 2-3 word phrase identifying the concept
- "page": The page number from the PDF where this information is found

If you cannot generate 6 distinct topics, return fewer items with a "note" field.
```

### 2. Assistant API Parameters

**BEFORE:**
```python
run = oai.beta.threads.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=ASSISTANT_ID
)
```

**AFTER:**
```python
run_params = {
    "thread_id": thread.id,
    "assistant_id": ASSISTANT_ID,
    "temperature": 0.7,      # Encourage variety
    "frequency_penalty": 0.3  # Discourage token repetition
}
run = oai.beta.threads.runs.create(**run_params)
```

---

### 3. Processing Logic

**BEFORE:**
```python
async def generate_quiz(topic_hint: str = "", num_questions: int = 6):
    prompt = f"""..."""
    reply = await ask_assistant(prompt, timeout=45)
    
    data = json.loads(reply_clean)
    
    # Validate questions
    valid_questions = []
    for item in data:
        if all(k in item for k in ("q", "options", "answer", "explain")):
            if len(item["options"]) == 4:
                item["answer"] = item["answer"].strip().upper()
                if item["answer"] in ["A", "B", "C", "D"]:
                    valid_questions.append(item)
    
    return valid_questions[:num_questions] if valid_questions else None
```

**AFTER:**
```python
async def generate_quiz(topic_hint: str = "", num_questions: int = 6):
    max_regeneration_attempts = 3
    unique_questions = []
    used_topics = []
    
    # Initial prompt with diversity requirements
    prompt = f"""..."""
    
    # Call with diversity parameters
    logger.info(f"Generating quiz: topic_hint='{topic_hint}', num_questions={num_questions}")
    reply = await ask_assistant(prompt, timeout=45, temperature=0.7, frequency_penalty=0.3)
    logger.info(f"Assistant raw reply (first 1000 chars): {reply[:1000]}")
    
    # Parse and validate
    data = json.loads(reply_clean)
    valid_questions = [...]
    
    # DEDUPLICATE
    unique_questions, used_topics = deduplicate_questions(valid_questions)
    logger.info(f"After deduplication: {len(unique_questions)} unique out of {len(valid_questions)}")
    
    # REGENERATION LOOP if needed
    attempt = 0
    while len(unique_questions) < num_questions and attempt < max_regeneration_attempts:
        attempt += 1
        needed = num_questions - len(unique_questions)
        logger.info(f"Regeneration attempt {attempt}: need {needed} more questions")
        
        # Request replacements excluding used topics
        regen_prompt = f"""Generate {needed + 2} questions.
        Do NOT use these topics: {', '.join(used_topics)}
        ..."""
        
        regen_reply = await ask_assistant(regen_prompt, timeout=45, 
                                          temperature=0.8, frequency_penalty=0.4)
        
        # Parse and add unique questions
        [... add non-duplicates to unique_questions ...]
    
    logger.info(f"Final quiz: {len(unique_questions)} questions")
    return unique_questions[:num_questions]
```

### 4. Example Output

**BEFORE (Problem):**
```json
[
  {
    "q": "What is the procedure for PUSHING the throttle during takeoff?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "A",
    "explain": "Reference (p.10)"
  },
  {
    "q": "How do you perform PUSHING on the throttle correctly?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "B",
    "explain": "Reference (p.11)"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is FUMBLE recovery during emergency?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "C",
    "explain": "Reference (p.20)"
  },
  {
    "q": "Steps for emergency FUMBLE situation?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "D",
    "explain": "Reference (p.21)"
  }
]
```
❌ Issues: Repeated "PUSHING", repeated "FUMBLE", similar questions

**AFTER (Solution):**
```json
[
  {
    "q": "What is the procedure for throttle operation during takeoff?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "A",
    "explain": "Reference (p.10)",
    "page": 10,
    "topic": "throttle-operation"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the emergency recovery procedure?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "C",
    "explain": "Reference (p.20)",
    "page": 20,
    "topic": "emergency-recovery"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the fuel capacity of the main tank?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "A",
    "explain": "Reference (p.30)",
    "page": 30,
    "topic": "fuel-capacity"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the maximum altitude for combat operations?",
    "options": ["...", "...", "...", "..."],
    "answer": "B",
    "explain": "Reference (p.40)",
    "page": 40,
    "topic": "altitude-limits"
  }
]
```
✅ All questions have unique topics, no repeated keywords

---

### 5. Logging

**BEFORE:**
- No logging of assistant responses
- Difficult to debug repeated questions
- No visibility into what the AI generated

**AFTER:**
```
logs/ai_replies.log:

2025-10-04 20:23:44,001 - app - INFO - Generating quiz: topic_hint='emergency procedures', num_questions=6
2025-10-04 20:23:44,001 - app - INFO - Assistant raw reply (first 1000 chars): [{"q": "What is...
2025-10-04 20:23:44,001 - app - INFO - After deduplication: 4 unique out of 6 initial questions
2025-10-04 20:23:44,001 - app - INFO - Used topics: ['throttle-operation', 'emergency-recovery', 'fuel-capacity', 'altitude-limits']
2025-10-04 20:23:44,001 - app - INFO - Regeneration attempt 1/3: need 2 more questions
2025-10-04 20:23:44,002 - app - INFO - Final quiz: 6 unique questions (requested: 6)
```

---

### 6. Similarity Detection

**BEFORE:**
- No similarity detection
- Duplicate questions returned to users

**AFTER:**
Three-method similarity detection:
1. **Exact topic match**: Both questions have topic "throttle-pushing" → Duplicate
2. **Fuzzy text similarity**: "What is X?" vs "How do you X?" → 87% similar → Duplicate
3. **Keyword overlap**: Both contain {"pushing", "throttle", "procedure"} → 60% overlap → Duplicate

---

### 7. Testing

**BEFORE:**
- No tests
- No way to verify deduplication

**AFTER:**
- 14 comprehensive unit tests
- Tests for topic extraction, keyword extraction, similarity detection
- Tests for deduplication logic
- Integration tests with mocked API responses
- All tests passing ✓

```bash
$ python run_tests.py
Ran 14 tests in 0.009s
OK
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Criterion 1**: For repeated runs, quizzes do not have more than one question sharing the same topic tag or dominant keyword

✅ **Criterion 2**: Raw assistant replies are logged for debugging (logs/ai_replies.log)

✅ **Criterion 3**: If assistant cannot produce distinct topics after retries, returns clear message or fewer questions

✅ **Criterion 4**: Unit tests demonstrate deduplication and replacement logic with mocked responses

### Key Components

- **Question Answering**: Uses OpenAI Assistants API with file search for accurate, grounded responses
- **Quiz Generation**: Dynamically creates diverse multiple-choice questions from documentation
- **Session Management**: Tracks quiz sessions per Discord channel
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Accepts approximate answers using Levenshtein distance

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot is not responding to commands**
- Verify the bot has proper permissions (Send Messages, Embed Links, Read Message History)
- Check that slash commands are enabled in your server
- Ensure the bot token is valid and the bot is online
- Run `/info` to verify bot is working

**Quiz questions are too similar**
- The bot uses topic diversity to generate varied questions
- Try specifying a topic hint with `/quiz_start topic:your-topic`
- Reduce the number of questions if generation is slow

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Check bot role permissions in Discord server settings
- Ensure bot role is above other roles in the hierarchy
- Grant "Use Application Commands" permission

**OpenAI API errors**
- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that the Assistant ID is correct
- Ensure the Assistant has file search enabled and PDFs uploaded

**Quiz timing out or not working**
- Only one quiz can run per Discord channel at a time
- End the current quiz with `/quiz_end` before starting a new one
- Check that quiz duration is between 1-60 minutes

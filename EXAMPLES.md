# Usage Examples

This document provides step-by-step examples of using DarkstarAIC for squadron SOP management.

## Scenario 1: New Squadron Setup

**Squadron: "Red Devils" DCS Squadron**

### Step 1: Admin Setup
Admin invites the bot and runs setup:

```
User: @Admin
Command: /setup

Bot Response:
‚úÖ Server setup complete!

‚Ä¢ Assistant ID: asst_abc123xyz789
‚Ä¢ Vector Store ID: vs_def456uvw012

Next steps:
1. Use /upload_document to upload your squadron SOP PDFs
2. Users can then use /ask to ask questions
3. Start quizzes with /quiz_start
```

### Step 2: Upload Documents
Admin uploads squadron SOPs:

```
User: @Admin
Command: /upload_document
Attachment: Red_Devils_SOP_2024.pdf (2.3 MB)

Bot Response:
‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully!

‚Ä¢ File: Red_Devils_SOP_2024.pdf
‚Ä¢ Size: 2.3 MB
‚Ä¢ File ID: file-abc123xyz

The document is now available for Q&A and quizzes!
```

Admin uploads additional documents:

```
User: @Admin
Command: /upload_document
Attachment: Emergency_Procedures.pdf (1.1 MB)

Bot Response:
‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully!

‚Ä¢ File: Emergency_Procedures.pdf
‚Ä¢ Size: 1.1 MB
‚Ä¢ File ID: file-def456uvw

The document is now available for Q&A and quizzes!
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
Admin checks uploaded documents:

```
User: @Admin
Command: /list_documents

Bot Response:
üìö Uploaded Documents (2)

Documents in this server's knowledge base:

üìÑ Red_Devils_SOP_2024.pdf
ID: file-abc123xyz
Size: 2.3 MB

üìÑ Emergency_Procedures.pdf
ID: file-def456uvw
Size: 1.1 MB
```

### Step 4: Squadron Members Use the Bot

#### Example 1: Ask a Question
```
User: @Pilot1
Command: /ask What's the standard formation for Case I recovery?

Bot Response:
According to the Squadron SOP (page 23), the standard formation for Case I recovery is:

1. **Initial Position**: Aircraft enter the break at 800 feet AGL
2. **Spacing**: 15-20 seconds between aircraft
3. **Speed**: 350 knots until the break
4. **Pattern**: Left-hand downwind pattern
5. **Final Turn**: No lower than 180 feet AGL

The pattern should be flown at 600 feet AGL on downwind, descending to 450 feet on base, and intercepting the 3.5¬∞ glideslope on final approach.

Reference: Red_Devils_SOP_2024.pdf, page 23
```

#### Example 2: Start a Quiz
```
User: @Pilot2
Command: /quiz_start questions:5 duration:10

## Scenario 2: Updating SOPs

**Situation**: Squadron updates their SOP document to version 2024.1

### Step 1: Remove Old Version
```
User: @Admin
Command: /list_documents

Bot Response:
üìö Uploaded Documents (2)

üìÑ Red_Devils_SOP_2024.pdf
ID: file-abc123xyz
Size: 2.3 MB

üìÑ Emergency_Procedures.pdf
ID: file-def456uvw
Size: 1.1 MB
```

```
User: @Admin
Command: /remove_document file-abc123xyz

Bot Response:
‚úÖ Document removed successfully!

‚Ä¢ File ID: file-abc123xyz

The document is no longer available for Q&A and quizzes.
```

### Step 2: Upload New Version
```
User: @Admin
Command: /upload_document
Attachment: Red_Devils_SOP_2024.1.pdf (2.5 MB)

Bot Response:
‚úÖ Document uploaded successfully!

‚Ä¢ File: Red_Devils_SOP_2024.1.pdf
‚Ä¢ Size: 2.5 MB
‚Ä¢ File ID: file-ghi789rst

The document is now available for Q&A and quizzes!
```

### Step 3: Announce to Squadron
Admin posts announcement:

```
üì¢ @everyone SOP Update!

The squadron SOP has been updated to version 2024.1. 

Key changes:
- Updated radio procedures (Chapter 3)
- New formation tactics (Chapter 7)
- Revised emergency procedures (Chapter 9)

Please review the new SOP and test your knowledge with /quiz_start!
```

## Scenario 3: Multi-Squadron Deployment

**Situation**: Two squadrons share the same bot instance

### Squadron A: "Red Devils"
```
Server: Red Devils Discord
Admin: @RedDevil_CO

Commands:
1. /setup ‚Üí Creates assistant for Red Devils
2. /upload_document ‚Üí Uploads Red_Devils_SOP.pdf
3. Members use /ask and /quiz_start with their docs
```

### Squadron B: "Blue Angels"  
```
Server: Blue Angels Discord
Admin: @BlueAngel_CO

Commands:
1. /setup ‚Üí Creates separate assistant for Blue Angels
2. /upload_document ‚Üí Uploads Blue_Angels_SOP.pdf
3. Members use /ask and /quiz_start with their docs
```

**Result**: Both squadrons have completely isolated knowledge bases. Questions in Red Devils server only access Red Devils documents, and vice versa.

## Scenario 4: Error Handling

### Case 1: User Tries Commands Before Setup
```
User: @NewMember
Command: /ask What is the standard approach speed?

Bot Response:

```

## Tips for Effective Use

### For Admins
1. **Organize documents**: Use clear filenames like "Squadron_SOP_v2.1.pdf"
2. **Version control**: Remove old versions before uploading new ones
3. **Test after upload**: Ask a few questions to verify indexing worked
4. **Communicate changes**: Announce SOP updates to your squadron
5. **Regular review**: Periodically check `/list_documents` and clean up

### For Members
1. **Be specific**: "What is the Case I recovery pattern?" is better than "Tell me about recovery"
2. **Use quizzes regularly**: Practice makes perfect - run quizzes weekly
3. **Review explanations**: Quiz explanations include page numbers for further study
4. **Report issues**: Let admins know if answers seem incorrect
5. **Check page references**: Verify important procedures in the actual SOP

### For Quiz Sessions
1. **Focused topics**: Use `/quiz_start topic:emergency-procedures` for targeted training
2. **Reasonable length**: 5-10 questions works well for most sessions
3. **Adequate time**: Allow 1-2 minutes per question minimum
4. **Team training**: Encourage multiple members to participate simultaneously
5. **Follow-up**: Discuss missed questions as a group after the quiz
